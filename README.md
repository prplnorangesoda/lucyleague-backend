# LucyLeague

Here's the backend for (hopefully [lucyleague.net](https://lucyleague.net) or [league.passtime.tf]). Please LET ME KNOW if there's anything stupid here like exposed API keys or insecure thingies.

## Running locally

This project is dockerized. Simply running `docker compose up` after cloning (AND MAKING A .env FILE!) should work out of the box. Submit an issue if this doesn't work!
